            <h3>Does this sound familiar?</h3>
            <p></p>You’ve worked with music for years. You’re an expert at drawing and copy pasting midi notes.
            You have this feeling that something fundamental is missing in your music making.
            You sometimes try using your keyboard to come up with ideas, but everything you do feels too basic
            to be useful.
            You wish you could contribute more in your cowriting sessions.
            You’ve looked at some youtube tutorials that … didn’t speak to you.
            It’s hard to find a teacher how understands what you need as a producer.
            You have a busy schedule and don’t have time to make learning piano a huge project in your life.</p>

            <p>You have a feeling that learning enough piano to start using it creatively is very far away, the
                not-in-this-lifetime sort of far away.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Hello, my name is Petter :)</h3>
            <p>I want to help you, because as a producer and piano player myself, I’ve experienced the immense power of
                performance – how recording a live take of an instrument as opposed to drawing the notes in midi, so
                often is what makes the difference between an ok sounding production – and a production that is buzzing
                alive, with excitement and originality.</p>
            <p>And I’ve spoken to countless producers who told me the same story of how amazing their life would be if
                they could play more piano.</p>
            <p>Being able to play the piano to record our ideas, as well as coming up with chord progressions and
                melodies in the heat of the moment, is a superpower I wish to give every producer.</p>
            <p>And as a piano teacher I’ve seen time and time again how it’s a reality not far away – the skills you
                need in order to be able to start jamming out ideas on the piano without feeling lost and being able to
                record your tracks, can be learnt in months, with a few daily minutes of consistent practice.</p>
            <p>So I set out to create a course that cuts the crap, boils down what you need as a producer, takes you by
                the hand and shows you exactly how to practice. So that you can sit down by the piano and press play,
                play along with me, and go from a beginner piano player to a confident and skilled pianist who can
                explore exciting chords and colors in all keys, with ease, and with joy.</p>
        </section>
