<h5>
	about me
</h5>
<div id="aboutme">
	I'm Petter Rylén, a Swedish songwriter, pianist and producer. I finished my masters in Music Performance in 2015 from the Rhythmic Music Conservatory in Copenhagen, and have since been working as a touring musician, composer and music educator. 
	<br><br>
	If you’re curious to know more about me I would recommend checking out <a href="http://petterrylen.com#albums">my albums</a>, or watching <a href="youtube.com/c/pianopetter">these videos</a>, about how I make music.

<div id="questions">
	<div>
	What happens when I sign up?
	</div> 
	After you have filled in the sign up form and made the payment, 
	I will ask you to send me 3 of your latest tunes 
	(if you already have written songs) 
	<div>
	What do I need? 
	</div>
	<ul>
	<li>A device that can do video calls.</li>
	<li>Daily access to either:
		<ul>
			<li> a chord instrument (piano, guitar, etc).</li>
			<li> a computer with a music making program (Ableton, Logic, Fruity Loops etc) + basic recording equipment.</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>Some spare time to work on your songs. </li>
	</ul>
	<div>
	How do I pay?
	</div>
	Paypal (or Swish if you live in Sweden).
	<div>
	What days do you teach?
	</div>
	Wednesdays and Thursdays.
	<div>
	What if I’m not good enough?
	</div>
	You are! My methods are about trying our best with whatever means we have at hand, 
	and constantly learning new things by trying out the things we can’t yet do. 
	So yes, if you are a human, this course is for you. 
	<div>
	I don’t want to sing? 
	</div>
	No problem, as long as you don’t mind me telling you to try it anyway. 
	<div>

	</div>
	Yes.
