        The world is black and white today<br>
        With a Final Cut Pro scratch effect <br><br>
        What does it mean? Is it an omen? Is something about to happen? Are we about to change? Will anything of
        significance
        ever? I feel like I'm powerless to make a change. Powerless to feel. Like I'm stuck on a train without power,
        without a
        driver, without water, in the middle of northern Sweden, with small towns, Sundsvall, where life is
        insignificant
        and
        nothing is new, could we live here, we ask ourselves every time, the houses near the central stations always
        look so
        pretty, hold so many promises, but the rest is always so Swedish, just the same, cold boring design, always the
        same,
        everything works so well but where is the soul, where is the pain, where are the mistakes, where are the people,
        they
        are going shopping in chains, I'm here looking out the windows making judgements, trying to be brave, wanting
        what I
        have instead of having what I want, being less, doing less, eating less, sleeping more, feeling more, crying
        more,
        being
        in the sand, with the sand, being the sand, feeling the sand, opening my heart to the world, to the old lady on
        the
        other table, to the other dad from Pakistan, to Sundsvall, to the rumbling low frequencies of life moving
        forward,
        almost in the direction I always wanted, but never quite arriving, all the trees I didn't see, all the moose who
        stood
        there looking at me, but I didn't see, why can't I be god, experience the whole world and every single atom as
        it
        passes
        by, I'm here stuck within a purple frame, but where is the purple rain
        <br><br>
        Golden lamps <br>
        Wooden walls <br>
        Curved ceiling <br>
        Mirror squares <br>
        The cat and the dog <br>
        The dad and the son <br>
        All sleeping, face down<br>
        People drinking beer in the window <br>
        Blue and green hair <br>
        Will I ever dare <br>
        <br><br>
        Why am I here? Where are we traveling? What are we gonna talk about? Will I find any peace this time? Will it
        end
        before
        it even started, as it always does?
        <br><br>
        And then it turns out the people are quite nice, smiling and asking questions at me, I hold on to my shield,
        mumbling
        and looking away, wishing they'd ask me what I'm doing for work, I'm a musician, magician, I make money for
        work, I
        defer the norms, I make meaning, I make a living, I make life, I make the living come alive, I am not a wizard,
        but
        I
        can make you learn piano chords faster than the total time you'll spend drawing midi notes over the next 30
        days,
        I'm a
        marketer, I'm a money maker, I'm a mantra creator, I'm a malleable mystery man, I'm a moon melody, I'm a mad
        mercury
        mason, I make mush, I make ming vases for a future in which money lost so much value we can all afford anything,
        like
        gods, we can all feel all the feelings of all the humans at the same time, we can feel the air and how the same
        molecules went through the nostrils of the guys bragging about how much church tax they pay and how nice it is
        to
        pee,
        then through me, through them, out again and to the lady eating chips and drinking water, circulating through us
        all
        and
        yet we assume we have nothing in common, it's so sad how we can't look each other in the eyes and play a game,
        unless
        there's a baby child in between us, then we don't mind
